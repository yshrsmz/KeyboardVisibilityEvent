Android Library to handle soft keyboard visibility change event.
show/hide keyboard method is also included.

## Library's status

Currently I don't have enough time to maintain this library, so I leave this as it is.  
I'm going to merge PRs when they arrive though ;)

## Features
- handle keyboard visibility change
- check if keyboard is currently visible
- show/hide keyboard(check UIUtil.java)

_Please note that as described in this [issue](https://github.com/yshrsmz/KeyboardVisibilityEvent/issues/1), currently the library cannot detect visibility change when the activity's `windowSoftInputMode` do not change Activity's height(such as `adjustNothing`)._

## Installation

from 2.0.0, AAR is distributed via jCenter.

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'net.yslibrary.keyboardvisibilityevent:keyboardvisibilityevent:2.1.0'
}
```

## Usage

check out sample project!

### Add event listener for keyboard change event

#### Automatically unregistering the event on the Activity's onDestroy
```java
KeyboardVisibilityEvent.setEventListener(
        getActivity(),
        new KeyboardVisibilityEventListener() {
            @Override
            public void onVisibilityChanged(boolean isOpen) {
                // some code depending on keyboard visiblity status
            }
        });
```

#### Manually unregistering the event
```java
// get Unregistrar
Unregistrar unregistrar = KeyboardVisibilityEvent.registerEventListener(
        getActivity(),
        new KeyboardVisibilityEventListener() {
            @Override
            public void onVisibilityChanged(boolean isOpen) {
                // some code depending on keyboard visiblity status
            }
        });

// call this method when you don't need the event listener anymore
unregistrar.unregister();
```
